name: flask
type: Python microframework for building web applications.
long_description: Flask is a Python-based framework for building web applications. It is based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2. 
  It is a minimalist, 'no batteries included' framework. Yet it can be scaled extensively and support complex applications and use cases. 
  It follows the philosophy that if something needs to be initialized, it should be initialized by the developer.

orm: Doesn't come with a built-in ORM framework, but there are many open source libraries that can be used. Such as 
    <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/" rel="nofollow">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a>,
    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Pony/" rel="nofollow">Flask-Pony</a>,
    etc.
orm_rating: 4

nosql: Flask doesn't get in the way and has no opinion of Relational vs NoSQL databases. 
  You could use a NoSQL database just as easily as you would a Relational database using extensions such as 
  <a href="https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">Flask-PyMong</a>
nosql_rating: 5


flex: Very flexible and doesn't require users to use any particular project or code layout. (A structured approach is still recommended.)
flex_rating: 5

companies: Netflix, Zillow, Lyft.

release_date: 2010

admin: No built-in admin panel, but you can use the <a href="https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin" rel="nofollow">Flask-Admin</a> extension. 
  It supports a number of backends like SQLAlchemy, MongoEngine, Peewee etc.

templating: Flask uses <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/templating/" rel="nofollow">Jinja2</a> out of the box.

web_forms: No built-in support but there is <a href="https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io" rel="nofollow">Flask-WTF</a> extention. 
  For SQLAlchemy support, that is, to create forms based on models, 
  there is <a href="https://wtforms-alchemy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">WTForms-Alchemy</a>

routing: Yes, using <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com" rel="nofollow">Werkzeug</a>.

auth: Only provides support for cookie-based sessions but there are extensions available for <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/">authentication, authorization and account management</a>.

testing: Built-in support using Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow">unittest</a> framework.

security: Despite being a minimalist Framework, Flask does an excellent job of addressing common security concerns like CSRF, XSS, JSON 
  security and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/security/" rel="nofollow">more</a> out of the box. 3rd party extensions like
  <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/" rel="nofollow">Flask-Security</a> can be used for common security measures.
  However, 3rd party extensions must be evaluated for security risks, and timely updates are crucial if a vulnerability. 
    is discovered in an extension.

restful: Supported via extensions such as <a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io" rel="nofollow">Flask-RESTful</a>,
  <a href="http://flask-classful.teracy.org/" rel="nofollow">Flask-Classful</a>, 
  <a href="https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io" rel="nofollow">Flask-RESTPlus</a>.


popularity_users: Used by 397,000 projects.
popularity_rating: 5

perf: Because it is minimal, it loads up very fast. Extensions could impact performance negatively.
perf_rating: 5

difficulty: Flask is lighter and very explicit. For people who are new to web development and only know Python, it is much easier and faster to learn.
