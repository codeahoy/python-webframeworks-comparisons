perf: Claims to have top-notch performance but virtue of being a microframework but 
  <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r13&hw=ph&test=query&l=4ftgjj&f=zik0zb-zik0zj-v2qiv3-zik0zj-zik0zj-zik0zj-3j" rel="nofollow">benchmarks prove it</a>
  to be slower than even Django beyond simple use cases. 
perf_rating: 3

difficulty: Being a microframework, the learning curve isn't very steep.
